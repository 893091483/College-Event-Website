All of our project code is stored in the folder "college_event_website". This folder also contains EXAMPLE SQL code and inserts. These are example only for the purpose of the report, as we use SQLite with Django framework. Our database is stored in the file "db.sqlite3" in the folder "college_event_website". The other folders are code for the website. The file "manage.py" is used to run the server, as below:


1. You must have python installed on your computer first, and it is necessary to have version 3.6 or higher. 

2. libraries and packages:
    pip install django
    pip install djangorestframework
    pip install django-crispy-forms
    pip install django-phone-field
    pip install Pillow
    pip install cryptography
    pip install urllib3

	If you encounter any issues with error code 1, the most common fix is to upgrade your pip version, as it is probably out of date. If you need this, the command is:
	(linux)
	python -m pip install -U pip
	(windows)
	py -m pip install -U pip
	Alternatively, ensure that you are in fact using python version 3.6 or higher and not python 2.

3. to run the program:
go to folder college_event_website
run command: python manage.py runserver

4. Open your local host in Chrome.
